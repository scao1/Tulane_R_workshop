This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
library("ggplot2")
library("reshape2")
gap.in <- read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", header = TRUE, sep ="\t")
newdata <- subset(gap.in, country %in% c("China", "Niger", "Hong Kong, China"))
head(newdata)
ggplot(newdata, aes(year, gdpPercap, color = country)) +geom_point() +facet_grid(.~ country) 
echo(The gdpPercap of Hong Kong incrase dramatically)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is a demo
